# Digital Comminication System With Shannon-Fano Coding

This project is an implementaion of a digital communication system using Shanon-Fano source coding. This is mostly supposed to show the effects of the intermidiate blocks.

The projects consists of the following:
- A MATLAB Livescript file, `impl.mlx` which holds all the implementaions.
- A folder `picures` containing some pictures that we used.
- A folder `wiki` containing the full description of this project.

This project was a joint effort between me and Amirhossein Rostami.

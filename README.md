# bsc-projects
Some of my university projects that upon revisiting, I did not immediately had the urge to gouge my eyes out.

These projects contain mainly 3 things:
- Project codes which are either the many code files or single files named `impl`.
- Results, which are usually bundled into a folder `Results` or addressed in the wikis.
- A standalone `wiki` folder, since most of them contain quite a lot of LaTeX equations, I preferred not to create a separate wiki for them on GitHub, since LaTeX is
kind of hard on GitHub markdown (this is why GitHub thinks everything in these projects is just HTML, trust me there is more :) ).

The wikis will have all the description for the projects that you'll need (I hope so at least!)

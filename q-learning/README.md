# Poor Man's Deep Q Learning
This is an implementation of Q-Learning with a bit of a spin on it.

Our implementation is to be emulated in a scenario similar to the one in [this paper](https://shadlenlab.columbia.edu/publications/publications/mike/yang_shadlen_2007.pdf).

This, being an assignment for a neroscience course, is trying to replicate this experiment with Q-Learning. This is a very old implementation and (as the name suggests) could use quite a bit of optimisation, which I hope I found the time soon!

Still, I believe the wiki might be of use to anyone trying to do the same thing, so I think this stilll might be usefull. You will find in this project:

- The `Results` folder which is all the things I managed to get out of this project.
- The file `impl.ipynb` which is the whole implementation.

This is purely educational in it's purpose, and as I said could very much benefit from some editing.

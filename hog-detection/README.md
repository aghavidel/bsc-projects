# Face Detection Using HOG Features

This project implements a simple face detector using *Histogram of Oriented Gradients* (HOG) features.

Our aim was to train a classifier on these features and then have it tested on some images. HOG is known to be very effective when it comes to face detection or pedestrian detection, and it is also reasonably fast, so we could create a dataset out of these featues and have it used for training the classifier.

You will find full description of the workflow in our implementation file, the contents of this project are:
- The full implementation file `impl.ipynb` which contains the complete implementation and description.
- The `resources` folder, which just contains some test images.
- 4 Python utility scripts, `visual`, `data`, `classifier` and `test`. The first one is a much bigger library and is not needed to be completely utilized in this project.
- An html version of the notebook also named `impl`.

# Some small statistical implementations in MATLAB

This little project contains a few implementations that might help anyone who is trying to learn about statistical inference using MATLAB.

The contents are:
- A detailed implementation of a T-test and Welch's test.
- A "Naive Bayesian" classifier.
- Some implementations of a simple regressor.

Each implementation is using some real dataset, which is pretty available worldwide. You can probably find all of them at [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) or UCI.

This is completely educational in it's nature, feel free to correct or laugh at any of my mistakes :)
